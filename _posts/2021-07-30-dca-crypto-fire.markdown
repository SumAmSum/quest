I grew up in Eastern Europe in a lower middle class family. My both parents were employed but I still haven't grew up with Gameboys, Xboxes or Playstations. Money wasn't meant to be for that. I got my first computer when I was 12 years old. Boy, oh boy did I love that computer. I've played ton of video games on it at the begining. But as the time progressed I started thinking I could also make some money with it and so I started creating websites. 

But this wasn't my final career. Even the one I have now probably isn't. See, I'm jack of all trades and I'm fairly good at many things but I excel at IT and that's why I stayed there.
