My wish is to retire at the reasonable age and this will be my experiment on how to do just that. Welcome to my quest and read all about it bellow. But first let me introduce myself and how I decided to start DCA into crypto FIRE.

I grew up in Eastern Europe in a lower middle class family. My both parents were employed but I still haven't grew up with Gameboys, Xboxes or Playstations. Money wasn't meant to be for that. I got my first computer when I was 12 years old. Boy, oh boy did I love that computer. I've played ton of video games on it at the begining. But as the time progressed I started thinking I could also make some money with it and so I started creating websites. 

But this wasn't my final career. Even the one I have now probably isn't. See, I'm jack of all trades and I'm fairly good at many things but I excel at IT and that's why I stayed there.
