## Month 5 update

2021 is over and what a year for crypto it was. Oh, I skipped a month again. Maybe it'll be a theme? Previous month would definitely look better on the attached screenshot but let's remember to look at the big picture - **5 years or longer**. A little dip is not important and it's actually encouraged by me because then when it actually pumps, those profits are so much sweeter to look at. 

In the last two months I bought **0.292 ETH** and it seems pretty consistent with 2 months before. Right now I have a profit of **5.46%** which is still better than losing money on the bank account because of the **5%** inflation this year. My wishes for 2022 would be that bear market finally comes and that I can convert even more money into ETH. I actually have something in the works that'll help me do that. Fingers crossed!
