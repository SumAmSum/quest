## Month 1 update

So how did my investment do in the first month of my journey? I was pleasantly surprised when I checked my portfolio after a month. I'm using ![Deltabadger](https://deltabadger.com/ref/DCAQUEST) for incremental purchasing of ETH and I really recommend it to all who want to start. If you use my [referral link](https://deltabadger.com/ref/DCAQUEST) you get 10% off!

Total investment was **100€ per week** or **459.42€** in a month and Deltabadger bought **0.18 ETH** in increments of **0.004 ETH** in time spans from 8 to 18h (depended on a price). Currently I'm netting 13.01% of interests! Try getting this at a bank. I know it can crash next day but right now I'm feeling pretty good.

## What did I learn in the first month?

I'm slowly learning to stop looking at the crypto prices and tell to myself that it don't matter in the long run. I still followed crypto prices closely but I was a bit more calm then usually. 

**Until next time crypto investors!**
