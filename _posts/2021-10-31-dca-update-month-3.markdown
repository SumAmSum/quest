## Month 3 update

We're already in month 3! And what a month it was. Some of you probably looked for a month 2 update but I was too busy at work to make a screenshot and then it was already too late. What happened in month 2 crypto wise? It was a pretty stagnant month and at the last day of the month I was having a loss. But Uptober changed everything. Bulls started to invest in October and everything changed.

For the first three weeks I was investing 100€/week and in the last week I've started investing **125€/month**. In the last two months I bought **0.296 ETH**. Right now I have **31.43%** of profit from the begining of the journey. It's really crazy right now but bear months are coming anyway. Probably right after the merge when more ETH will be released from the lock. I actually can't wait to buy cheap ETH again.
