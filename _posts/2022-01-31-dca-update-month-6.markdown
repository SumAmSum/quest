## Month 6 update

2022 has entered! And what a red month it is. I can't say I don't love it though. Because by buying ETH with a lower price only means so much more gains later on. I really hope we're entering at least 2 year bear market so I can buy as much ETH as I can. If previous bear markets are any indicator we'll see from -90% to -95% reduction in price which would mean ETH at $480. 

In the last month I bought **0.204 ETH** because of the steady decline in the ETH price. I'm currently in red with **-25.92%**. AS I mentioned a few times before the goal is to invest for **5 years or more** and with the latest predictions from Arc invest on how ETH will reach $180,000.00 in 2030 it's a great time to accumulate as much ETH as I can.
